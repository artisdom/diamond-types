//! Some code in here will be moved out when diamond types supports more data structures.
//!
//! Currently this code only supports lists of unicode characters (text documents). Support for
//! more data types will be added over time.

/// A branch stores a checkout / snapshot of a document at some moment in time. Branches are the
/// normal way for editors to interact with an [OpLog](OpLog), which stores the actual change set.
///
/// Internally, branches simply have two fields:
///
/// - Content (Ie, the list with all its values)
/// - Version
///
/// At the root version (the start of history), a branch is always empty.
///
/// Branches obey a very strict mutability rule: Whenever the content changes, the version
/// *must change*. A branch (with content at some named version) is always valid. But future changes
/// can always be merged in to the branch via [`branch.merge()`](Branch::merge).
///
/// Branches also provide a simple way to edit documents, via the [`insert`](Branch::insert) and
/// [`delete`](Branch::delete) methods. These methods append new operations to the oplog, and modify
/// the branch to contain the named changes.

    /// the associated functions on Branch.

/// An OpLog is a collection of Diamond Types operations, stored in a super fancy compact way. Each
/// operation has a number of fields:
///
/// - Type (insert or delete)
/// - ID (unique Agent ID + sequence number pair)
/// - Parents - which names the document's version right before this edit was created.
/// - Origin edit position (when the edit was created) + length
/// - Content of what was inserted or deleted. Storing this is optional.
///
/// The OpLog structure stores all this data in a SoA (Struct Of Arrays) format, which lets us
/// run-length encode each field individually. This makes all operations significantly faster, but
/// it makes the code to read changes significantly more complex.
///
/// The OpLog API supports:
///
/// - Reading operations (via a few iterator methods + helpers)
/// - Reading transformed operations (This is useful for applying changes to a local document state)
/// - Encoding and decoding operation sets to and from binary formats
/// - Appending operations which have been created locally or remotely
/// - Creating a "checkout" (snapshot) of the document at any requested point in time
/// - Interacting with the time DAG, to merge changes or list which operations a peer might be
///   missing.
///
/// Well, it should. The public API is still a work in progress. I'm going to be tweaking method
/// names and things a fair bit before we hit 1.0.

/// The times you don't want to use a ListCRDT:
///
/// - Nodes often don't care about the current document state. If you're using DT in a context
///   where you're mostly just passing patches around and you don't actually need a live copy of the
///   document state, just use an OpLog. You can always call [`oplog.checkout()`](OpLog::checkout)
///   to figure out what the document looks like at any specified moment in time.
/// - If you're interacting with a document with multiple branches, you'll probably want to
///   instantiate the oplog (and any visible branches) separately.
