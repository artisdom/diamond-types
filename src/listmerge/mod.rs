//! This module is the second implementation for handling positional updates. Instead of generating
//! a series of patches and merging them, this code applies patches by making a positional map and
//! moving backwards in time.
//!
//! There's a bunch of ways this code could be written:
//!
//! 1. We could store the content tree + position map in the same structure or separately (as in
//! PositionMap in dt-crdt)
//! 2. When moving around, we could either scan the list and rewrite it (activating and deactivating
//! entries as we go). Or we could figure it out by walking the txns forwards and backwards through
//! time.
