This is a fully working, optimized implementation of the sequence CRDT from diamond types, but implemented as a traditional CRDT rather than using the new "time travel" algorithm.

This code is kept alive mostly for comparative benchmarking, since this codebase employs all the same optimization tricks as the other implementation.
